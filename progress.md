# Shelf Agents Progress

## 2025-10-29
- Reviewed `AGENTS.md` to restate the sequential work agreement: focus on one milestone at a time with clear hand-offs.
- Captured initial implementation priorities for agents: planner/executor shell, core skills, and smoke coverage.
- Next milestone: scaffold `lib/agents/planner.ts` and `lib/agents/executor.ts` to establish the runtime shell.
- Implemented planner and executor scaffolding with typed plan steps, skill registry hooks, and retry-aware execution.
- Upcoming focus: wire up foundational skills (`parse_url`, provider hydrators, `upsertLink`) and exercise a basic smoke path.
- Delivered initial core skills: URL parsing, provider hydration wrappers, and link persistence scaffold with provider helpers.
- Added a smoke test harness (`npm run test:agents`) covering the hydrate plan end-to-end with a Reddit fixture.
